## Hosting The Games

Below are some of the options you can use to deploy your own copy of the games. **If you do not know what you are doing, it is suggested that you use a link someone is currently hosting!** For Replit the games have been divided into 1 GB parts due to replits hosting limitations.

Replit:
After you click the "Run on replit" button you will be brought to replit, make sure to select HTML as the language or else it won"t work. You should see a webview in the side bar, copy the link in the url bar and paste it into a new tab. This url should looks simialr to this: "https://html-games-collection-replit-2-4.tylerwilson32.repl.co/" then look at the name of the folder eg. "froggys-battle" add this to the end of the url and it should look similar to this "https://html-games-collection-replit-2-4.tylerwilson32.repl.co/froggys-battle/".
